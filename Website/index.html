                                century, it is suggested that the Moon was
                                once part of the Earth and was separated

                                was formed somewhere else in the solar
                                system and was captured by Earth's gravity.

                                suggests that both Earth and the Moon formed

                                accepted theory today. It proposes that a

                                with the early Earth about 4.5 billion years

                <h3>Causes of Moonquakes ?</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Earth’s gravity: the pull of Earth’s gravity
                            tugging and stretching the Moon’s internal
                            structures.</li>
                        <li>shrinkage : The Moon is shrinking as its
                            interior cools, causing disturbance in the moon
                            results in quakes.</li>
                        <li>Meteoroid impacts: Because the Moon has no
                            atmosphere, meteoroids colliding with the Moon
                            reach the surface without ‘burning out’ Only a
                            very small fraction of a meteoroid's kinetic
                            energy is converted to seismic energy.</li>
                        <li>Thermal expansion and contraction of rocks: as
                            it goes from the frigid lunar night to the very
                            hot lunar daytime, so that results in
                            moonquakes.</li>

                    <h2>Moonquakes VS Earthquakes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Certainly! Both "moonquakes" and "earthquakes" refer
                        to seismic activities, but as their names suggest,
                        they occur on different celestial bodies. The main
                        two differences are: <br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Moonquakes last longer than Earthquakes !</h3>
                    <p>Earthquakes last for from 10 to 30 seconds and the
                        biggest one lasts for 2 minutes , but all moonquakes
                        last for 10 minutes.</p>
                    <h3>Why ?</h3>
                    <p>The reason is that "Water weakens stone" When energy
                        propagates across such a compressible structure, it
                        acts like a foam sponge, so it deadens the
                        vibrations.</p>
                    <h3>Moonquakes are weaker than Earthquakes !</h3>
                    <p>The strongest moonquake, which is 5.5 Richter , 5
                        Richter on Earth can only move heavy furniture and
                        crack plaster.</p>
                    <h3>Why ?</h3>
                    <p>Quakes occur because of energy released when the
                        tectonic plates slide over each other or break ,and
                        because the tectonic plates of Earth are more
                        complex than those of moon , so Moonquakes are
                        weaker than Earthquakes.</p>
                    <h3>Future direction in research due to Moonquakes </h3>
                    <p>In the coming years, NASA plans to land more
                        seismometers on more parts of the moon to learn
                        about the frequency and severity of quakes. Without
                        more information, lunar colonists could be in more
                        danger and stress if they settle in a
                        moonquake-prone region!</p>

                    <h2>Moon internal structure</h2>
                    <h3>Crust :</h3>
                    <p>The crust is the outermost layer of the moon, and it
                        consists of a dusty outer rock layer which is known
                        as the regolith. The regolith is a rocky layer that
                        looks like broken concrete which has been blasted
                        apart and fused back together. The crust is
                        approximately 37 miles in thickness on the side
                        which faces the earth and approximately 62 miles on
                        the other side. The rocks found on the crust are
                        almost the same as those found on the crust of the
                        earth. The only difference is the fact that the
                        rocks have more aluminum and titanium than those
                        found on earth. The moon's crust also contains some
                        magnetism like the crust of the earth. Studies show
                        that this layer mainly comprises of silicon, iron,
                        magnesium, oxygen, calcium, and aluminum.</p>
                    <h3>Mantle:</h3>
                    <p>This is the layer between the core and the crust of
                        the moon. The mantle is divided into two parts. The
                        first layer of the mantle is the rigid lithosphere
                        (upper mantle). This layer of the moon is estimated
                        to be 620 miles in thickness, and it is not hot
                        enough to flow.

                        The second layer of the mantle is the asthenosphere
                        (lower mantle). The asthenosphere is not rigid like
                        the upper mantle. The innermost parts of the
                        asthenosphere are hot enough to flow. The
                        asthenosphere layer can transmit seismic waves which
                        cause quakes. The mantle is believed to be largely
                        comprised of olivine, orthopyroxene and
                        clinopyroxene minerals.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Core:</h3>
                    <p>
                        • The Moon's core is much smaller relative to its
                        volume than Earth's core. It's not entirely
                        well-defined in terms of its size and composition.<br>
                        • The core is believed to be partially molten and
                        consists primarily of iron, with smaller amounts of
                        sulfur and nickel.<br>
                        It can be further divided into:<br>
                        • <span>Inner Core:</span> Solid and comprises
                        mainly iron. It's estimated to have a radius of
                        about 240 km, though estimates can vary.<br>
                        • <span>Outer Core:</span> Surrounds the inner core
                        and is thought to be molten, with a radius extending
                        roughly to about 500 km from the Moon's center.<br>

                        • The moon's core makes up only 2-4% of the total
                        mass of the moon. This layer does not create a big
                        magnetic field. The magnetic field of the moon is
                        estimated to be 1/10 millionth of the magnetic field
                        of the earth.<br>

                                primary motivations for studying the Moon's
                                structure is to gain insights into its
                                origin. The leading theory about the Moon's
                                formation is the Giant Impact Hypothesis,
                                which suggests that a Mars-sized body, often
                                referred to as Theia, collided with the
                                early Earth. Debris from this collision
                                eventually coalesced to form the Moon.
                                Understanding the Moon's interior can
                                provide evidence for or against this theory.

                        The discovery and understanding of the Moon's

                                absorbed by internal layers), scientists can
